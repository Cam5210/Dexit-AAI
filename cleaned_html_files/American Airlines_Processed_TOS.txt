Text: This content can be expanded
Text: A flight is “oversold” when there are more checked-in passengers than seats. When this happens, our team gets involved as early as possible to find volunteers to change flights.
Text: When, despite our best efforts, we don’t have enough volunteers, we'll have to choose customers to change flights involuntarily, and deny boarding. If this happens, we will follow the DOT's compensation rules. We will do our best to get those customers on the next possible flight.
Text: We will not involuntarily remove a revenue passenger who has already boarded to give a seat to another passenger.
Text: Voluntary denied boarding
Text: We will ask for passengers who are willing to voluntarily give up their seats in exchange for compensation in an amount and form to be determined solely at American’s discretion.
Text: When you volunteer to give up your confirmed seat on a flight, we will compensate you in a form and in an amount we think is fair.
Text: Involuntary denied boarding
Text: If there aren’t enough volunteers, we will choose customers to change flights involuntarily and deny boarding.
Text: Boarding priority is given to certain customers, including to those who:
Text: Have special assistance needs
Text: Are traveling as an unaccompanied minor
Text: Have AAdvantage elite status
Text: Paid for First, Business or Premium Economy
Text: Checked in earliest
Text: The selection of customers who are involuntarily denied seats is solely at American’s discretion.
Text: You will not receive involuntary denied boarding compensation if:
Text: You fail to comply with American’s ticketing, check-in and reconfirmation requirements, or you’re not acceptable for transportation under American’s usual rules and practices.
Text: Your flight is canceled.
Text: We switch to a smaller plane for safety or operational reasons.
Text: Your plane has 60 or fewer seats and there are safety-related weight/balance restrictions.
Text: You’re offered a seat in a section of the plane that’s different from your original ticket. If you are seated in a section for which a lower fare is charged, you will be given an appropriate refund.
Text: We’re able to get you to your next stopover or final destination within 1 hour of your original arrival time.
Text: Compensation for involuntary denied boarding
Text: DOT rules determine how much you're compensated based on how late you’ll be to your stopover or destination. Our goal is to get you to your next scheduled stopover or final destination as soon as possible, so we may offer flights on other airlines and non-air travel such as by train. If your flight is oversold and you're not allowed to board, we'll give you a check or travel credit the same day at the airport or mail it within 24 hours.
Text: Travel within U.S.
Text: Up to 1 hour arrival delay – not compensated
Text: 1 - 2 hour arrival delay – 200% of one-way fare (max. $775)
Text: 2+ hour arrival delay – 400% of one-way fare (max. $1,550)
Text: International
Text: Up to 1 hour arrival delay – not compensated
Text: 1 - 4 hour arrival delay – 200% of one-way fare (max. $775)

Text: Travel from European Union countries (EU)
Text: If you're not allowed to board an oversold, nonstop flight from the EU to the U.S., you may be eligible to receive one of these:
Text: A travel voucher that can be used for 1 ticket to anywhere American flies
Text: A check for 300 EUR (arrival delays under 4 hours) or 600 EUR (arrival delays more than 4 hours)
Text: Travel to or from Canada
Text: If you’re not allowed to board a flight to or from Canada, the Canada Air Passenger Protection Regulations may provide additional protections, including compensation.

Text: Delays, cancellations and diversions
Text: This content can be expanded
Text: Our goal is to provide timely, frequent and helpful updates – from the time you are ticketed, at the airport and on board – when there are delays, cancellations and diversions.
Text: Rebooking your delayed / canceled flight
Text: When your flight is canceled or a delay could cause you to miss your connection, we'll rebook you on the next American Airlines flight with available seats at no additional cost. If no American flights are available until the next day, and the disruption is caused by us, we’ll rebook you on one of our partner airlines with available seats at no additional cost. We’ll rebook you in your originally ticketed cabin or class with your original form of payment.
Text: If your flight was delayed or canceled and you don’t accept our alternative arrangements, or none were available, we'll refund the remaining ticket value and any optional fees according to our involuntary refunds policy. Beyond that, we have no further contractual obligation.
Text: Delays caused by us
Text: If the disruption is our fault or you're diverted to another city, and we don't board before 11:59 p.m. local time on your scheduled arrival day, we'll arrange an overnight stay or cover the cost of an approved hotel, if available. We don’t guarantee reimbursement for hotel expenses if you book directly without written authorization from American Airlines.
Text: Delays beyond our control (like weather)
Text: If the delay is beyond our control, or you book your own arrangements without written authorization from American Airlines, you're responsible to pay for your hotel, meals and other expenses. An American Airlines agent may be able to help you find a hotel.
Text: Taking care of delayed passengers
Text: We'll do our best to ensure delayed passengers are as comfortable as possible. Gate agents are asked to look after customers with special needs including unaccompanied minors, customers with disabilities and the elderly.
Text: For long delays on the plane, we'll make every reasonable effort to ensure you have food (such as crackers or biscuits), water, access to the restroom and basic medical assistance if needed.
Text: We are not responsible for any special, incidental or consequential damages if we're unable to meet this commitment.

Text: Your ticket, bags and refunds
Text: Baggage
Text: This content can be expanded
Text: All bags are subject to inspection. We will not accept checked or carry-on bags we think are unsuitable for transportation for reasons like size, weight or character.
Text: Before you go to the airport, be sure to check our baggage page for information on all our checked and carry-on baggage policies.
Link: /i18n/travel-info/baggage/baggage.jsp
Text: Baggage
Text: Checking your bag
Text: You can only check bags on the day you travel, and your bags must travel to the same ticketed final destination as you. Be sure your name is on all bags before you check them.
Text: If you're flying from one of these airports, you can't check bags more than 4 hours before departure:
Text: Denver (DEN)
Text: Fort Lauderdale (FLL)
Text: Las Vegas (LAS)
Text: Orlando (MCO)
Text: Portland (PDX)
Text: Salt Lake City (SLC)
Text: Seattle (SEA)
Text: Baggage limits and fees

Text: Also, you may have to pay bag fees again if:
Text: You are connecting on another airline
Text: Your connection on American is more than 16.5 hours later

Text: Claiming your bag
Text: Hang on to your baggage claim tickets; you may have to show your ticket to claim your bags. The airport baggage office will release bags to the person with the baggage claim ticket that matches. If you lose your ticket, we may ask for ID.
Text: When you arrive in the U.S. from an international city, you will claim your checked bags before going through Customs.
Text: Delayed bags
Text: If you arrive on American at your final destination and your bags have not arrived with you, our goal is to return them within 24 hours (for flights within the U.S., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands).
Text: Some of the reasons it may take us longer to get you your delayed bags include if:
Text: We don't have a local name, address or phone number for you
Text: You're on a cruise, in remote camp site or somewhere we can't reasonably reach you
Text: You changed your delivery address
Text: We have limited flights to your destination
Text: Weather or other operational issues get in the way
Text: If you arrive at your final destination on another airline, please check with that airline for information.
Text: Carry-on bags
Text: In general, you're allowed 1 bag and 1 personal item:
Text: Your bag must fit in the sizer at the airport.
Text: Your personal item must fit under the seat in front of you.
Text: All bags must be stowed before takeoff.
Text: Diaper bags, child safety seats, strollers and medical or mobility devices don’t count as your bag or personal item. You may carry on a fully collapsible stroller if it's under 20 lbs. and fits in an overhead bin. All other strollers must be checked at a ticket counter.
Text: We always reserve the right to decide if your carry-on items are suitable to bring on board and if there is enough space in the overhead bins.
Text: If you need to check your carry-on bags, be sure to take any fragile or valuable items like your keys, medication or computers with you on board. Also remove and carry on any e-cigarettes and spare batteries for laptops, cameras or other mobile devices.
Text: There are additional carry-on restrictions for certain fares, aircraft and airports. We may have to check your bag at the gate if the overhead bins are full or if there are restrictions. Overhead bin size varies, and some planes and American Eagle flights have smaller bins.

Text: Carry-on baggage policy
Text: Restricted items
Text: For everyone's safety on board, some common items are restricted by the TSA and FAA. Be sure you know what you can carry on and what you can check in your bags before you go to the airport.

Text: Pets and service animals
Text: Depending on the animals' breed, size and requirements, pets can travel as a carry-on, be checked or transported with American Airlines Cargo. We only allow you to travel with your pet cats and dogs.
Text: Service animals are welcome at no charge if they meet the requirements. The animal must fit on your lap, at your feet or under your seat, and cannot block the aisle. Dogs trained to detect explosives/drugs or trained for search and rescue (documentation required) are also welcome at no charge.

Text: If your checked bag is lost, damaged or delayed, we will pay the provable value of the losses up to $3,800 (or up to $5,000 if you declare excess value).

Text: If unused, you must start travel within 1 year of date the ticket was issued

Some countries have different rules about refunds, and if so, we will follow those rules.

Text: Refundable tickets
Text: If you bought a refundable ticket, decide not to travel and want a refund, we'll pay:
