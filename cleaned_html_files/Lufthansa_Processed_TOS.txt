Text: 2. Proprietary rights
Text: All trademark rights, copyrights, database rights and other intellectual property rights to the contents of the Lufthansa website (as well as the organization and layout of the website), together with the underlying software code, are the property either of Deutsche Lufthansa AG or its licensors.

You may only use the website in accordance with these terms and conditions and for the legally permitted purposes described above. In particular, you indicate your agreement to the following:

Text: Lufthansa accepts no liability whatsoever for the topicality, accuracy, completeness or quality of the information provided by third parties (e.g. co-operation partners, tour operators, airport operators, website users). Claims for liability against Lufthansa relating to damages of a material or non-material kind, which were caused by usage or non-usage of the information presented, are excluded, unless there is evidence of wilful or grossly negligent fault on Lufthansa’s part.
