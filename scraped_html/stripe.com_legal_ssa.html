  <h2 id="general-terms">General Terms</h2><p>Last modified: December 15, 2023</p><p>You and Stripe agree as follows:</p><h3 id="1-your-stripe-account">1.  Your Stripe Account.</h3><h4 id="11-eligibility">1.1    Eligibility.</h4><p>Only businesses (including sole proprietors) and non-profit organizations located in the United States are eligible to apply for a Stripe Account and use the Services. Stripe and its Affiliates may provide Services to you or your Affiliates in other countries or regions under separate agreements. You and your Representative must not attempt to create a Stripe Account on behalf of or for the benefit of a user whose use of the Stripe services was suspended or terminated by Stripe, unless Stripe approves otherwise.</p><h4 id="12-business-representative">1.2    Business Representative.</h4><p>You and your Representative individually affirm to Stripe that (a) your Representative is authorized to provide User Information on your behalf and to bind you to this Agreement; and (b) your Representative is an executive officer, senior manager or otherwise has significant responsibility for the control, management or direction of your business. Stripe may require you or your Representative to provide additional information or documentation demonstrating your Representative’s authority. </p><h4 id="13-sole-proprietors">1.3    Sole Proprietors.</h4><p>If you are a sole proprietor, you and your Representative also affirm that your Representative is personally responsible and liable for your use of the Services and your obligations to Customers, including payment of amounts you owe under this Agreement.</p><h4 id="14-age-requirements">1.4    Age Requirements.</h4><p>If you are a sole proprietor, and you are not old enough to enter into a contract on your own behalf (which is commonly but not always 18 years old), but you are 13 years old or older, your Representative must be your parent or legal guardian. If you are a legal entity that is owned, directly or indirectly, by an individual who is not old enough to enter into a contract on their own behalf, but the individual is 13 years old or older, your Representative must obtain the consent of either your board or an authorized officer. The approving board, authorized officer, parent or legal guardian is responsible to Stripe and is legally bound to this Agreement as if it had agreed to this Agreement itself. You must not use the Services if you are under 13 years of age.</p><h3 id="2-services-and-support">2.  Services and Support.</h3><h4 id="21-services">2.1    Services.</h4><p>Stripe (and its Affiliates, as applicable) will make available to you the Services, including those described in the applicable Services Terms, and, if applicable, give you access to a Stripe Dashboard.</p><h4 id="22-services-terms-order-of-precedence">2.2    Services Terms; Order of Precedence.</h4><p>The Services Terms contain specific terms governing the parties’ rights and obligations related to the Services described in those Services Terms. If there are no Services Terms for a particular Stripe service, then only these General Terms govern. By accessing or using a Service, you agree to comply with the applicable Services Terms. If any term in these General Terms conflicts with a term in any Services Terms or set of terms incorporated by reference into this Agreement, then unless terms of lower precedence expressly state to the contrary, the order of precedence is: (a) the Services Terms; (b) these General Terms; and (c) all terms incorporated by reference into this Agreement. Your access to or use of the Services may also be subject to additional terms to which you agree through the Stripe Dashboard.</p><h4 id="23-service-modifications-and-updates">2.3    Service Modifications and Updates.</h4><p>Stripe may modify the Services and Stripe Technology at any time, including adding or removing functionality or imposing conditions on use of the Services. Stripe will notify you of material adverse changes in, deprecations to, or removal of functionality from, Services or Stripe Technology that you are using. Stripe is not obligated to provide any Updates. However, if Stripe makes an Update available, you must fully install the Update by the date or within the time period stated in Stripe’s notice; or, if there is no date or period stated in the notice, then no later than 30 days after the date of the notice.</p><h4 id="24-subcontracting">2.4    Subcontracting.</h4><p>Stripe may subcontract its obligations under this Agreement to third parties.</p><h4 id="25-services-restrictions">2.5    Services Restrictions.</h4><p>You may only use the Services for business purposes. You must not, and must not enable or allow any third party to:  </p><p>(a) use the Services for personal, family or household purposes;</p><p>(b) act as service bureau or pass-through agent for the Services with no added value to Customers;</p><p>(c) work around any of the technical limitations of the Services or enable functionality that is disabled or prohibited, or access or attempt to access non-public Stripe systems, programs, data, or services; </p><p>(d) except as Law permits, reverse engineer or attempt to reverse engineer the Services or Stripe Technology;</p><p>(e) use the Services to engage in any activity that is illegal, fraudulent, deceptive or harmful; </p><p>(f) perform or attempt to perform any action that interferes with the normal operation of the Services or affects other Stripe users’ use of Stripe services;</p><p>(g) exceed any Services usage limitations stated in the Documentation; or</p><p>(h) copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit, resell, or distribute in any way, any part of the Services, Documentation, or the Stripe Website except as permitted by Law.</p><h4 id="26-beta-services">2.6    Beta Services.</h4><p>(a) <em>Classification</em>. Stripe may classify certain Stripe services or Stripe Technology, including a particular release or feature, as Beta. A Stripe service may be generally available in some circumstances (e.g., in some countries or regions) while still classified as Beta in other circumstances. </p><p>(b) <em>Nature of Beta Services</em>. By their nature, Beta Services may be feature-incomplete or contain bugs. Stripe may describe limitations that exist within a Beta Service; however, your reliance on the accuracy or completeness of these descriptions is at your own risk. You should not use Beta Services in a production environment until and unless you understand and accept the limitations and flaws that may be present in the Beta Services. </p><p>(c) <em>Feedback</em>. Unless Stripe otherwise agrees in writing, your use of Beta Services is confidential, and you must provide timely Feedback on the Beta Services in response to Stripe requests. </p><p>(d) <em>Availability During Beta Period</em>. Stripe may suspend or terminate your access to any Beta Services at any time. </p><h4 id="27-support">2.7    Support.</h4><p>Stripe will provide you with support to resolve general issues relating to your Stripe Account and your use of the Services through resources and documentation that Stripe makes available on the Stripe Website and in the Documentation. Stripe’s support is also available by contacting Stripe at <a class="
    Link
    
  " href="https://stripe.com/contact" data-js-controller="AnalyticsButton" data-analytics-category="Links" data-analytics-action="Clicked" data-analytics-label="Related content">contact us</a>. Stripe is not responsible for providing support to Customers.</p><h4 id="28-third-party-services">2.8    Third-Party Services.</h4><p>Stripe may reference, enable you to access, or promote (including on the Stripe Website) Third-Party Services. These Third-Party Services are provided for your convenience only and Stripe does not approve, endorse, or recommend any Third-Party Services to you. <strong>Your access and use of any Third-Party Service is at your own risk and Stripe disclaims all responsibility and liability for your use of any Third-Party Service. Third-Party Services are not Services and are not governed by this Agreement or Stripe’s Privacy Policy. Your use of any Third-Party Service, including those linked from the Stripe Website, is subject to that Third-Party Service’s own terms of use and privacy policies (if any).</strong></p><h3 id="3-information-your-business">3.  Information; Your Business.</h3><h4 id="31-user-information">3.1    User Information.</h4><p>Upon Stripe’s request, you must provide User Information to Stripe in a form satisfactory to Stripe. You must keep the User Information in your Stripe Account current. You must promptly update your Stripe Account with any changes affecting you, the nature of your business activities, your Representative, beneficial owners, principals, or any other pertinent information. You must immediately notify Stripe, and provide to Stripe updated User Information, if (a) you experience or anticipate experiencing a Change of Control; (b) you experience or anticipate experiencing a material change in your business or financial condition, including if you experience or are likely to experience an Insolvency Proceeding; (c) the regulatory status of the business for which you are using the Services changes, including if it becomes subject, or no longer subject, to regulatory oversight; or (d) a Governmental Authority has notified you that you or your business is the subject of investigative action.</p><h4 id="32-information-retrieved-by-stripe">3.2    Information Retrieved by Stripe.</h4><p>You authorize Stripe to retrieve information about you and your business from Stripe’s service providers and other third parties, including credit reporting agencies, banking partners and information bureaus, and you authorize and direct those third parties to compile and provide that information to Stripe. This information may include your, or your Representative’s, name, addresses, credit history, banking relationships, and financial history. </p><h3 id="4-services-fees-taxes">4.  Services Fees; Taxes.</h3><h4 id="41-services-fees">4.1    Services Fees.</h4><p>The Fees are stated on the Stripe Pricing Page, unless you and Stripe otherwise agree in writing. Stripe may revise the Fees at any time. If Stripe revises the Fees for a Service that you are currently using, Stripe will notify you at least 30 days before the revised Fees apply to you.</p><h4 id="42-collection-of-fees-and-other-amounts">4.2    Collection of Fees and Other Amounts.</h4><p>You must pay, or ensure that Stripe is able to collect, Fees and other amounts you owe under this Agreement when due. Stripe may deduct, recoup or setoff Fees and other amounts you owe under this Agreement, or under any other agreements you have with Stripe or any of its Affiliates, from your Stripe Account balance, or invoice you for those amounts. If you fail to pay invoiced amounts when due, if your Stripe Account balance is negative or does not contain funds sufficient to pay amounts that you owe under this Agreement, or under any other agreement with Stripe or any of its Affiliates, or if Stripe is unable to collect amounts due from your Stripe Account balance, then Stripe may, to the extent Law permits, deduct, recoup or setoff those amounts from: (a) if established and applicable, each Reserve; (b) funds payable by Stripe or its Affiliate to you or your Affiliate; (c) if established, each User Affiliate Reserve; (d) each User Bank Account; and (e) the Stripe account balance of each Stripe account that Stripe determines, acting reasonably, is associated with you or your Affiliate. If the currency of the amount being deducted is different from the currency of the amount you owe, Stripe may deduct, recoup or setoff an amount equal to the amount owed (using Stripe’s conversion rate) together with any fees Stripe incurs in making the conversion.</p><h4 id="43-debit-authorization">4.3    Debit Authorization.</h4><p>Without limiting Section 4.2 of these General Terms, you authorize Stripe to debit each User Bank Account without separate notice, and according to the applicable <a class="

  " href="https://stripe.com/legal/bank-debit-authorizations" data-js-controller="AnalyticsButton" data-analytics-category="Links" data-analytics-action="Clicked" data-analytics-label="Related content">User Bank Account Debit Authorization</a>, to collect amounts you owe under this Agreement. If Stripe is unable to collect those amounts by debiting a User Bank Account, then you immediately grant to Stripe a new, original authorization to debit each User Bank Account without notice and according to the applicable <a class="
    Link
    
  " href="https://stripe.com/legal/bank-debit-authorizations" data-js-controller="AnalyticsButton" data-analytics-category="Links" data-analytics-action="Clicked" data-analytics-label="Related content">User Bank Account Debit Authorization</a>. Stripe may rely on this authorization to make one or more attempts to collect all or a subset of the amounts owed. Your authorization under this Section 4.3 will remain in full force and effect until (a) all of your Stripe Accounts are closed; or (b) all fees and other amounts you owe under this Agreement are paid, whichever occurs later. If applicable debit scheme authorization rules grant you the right to revoke your debit authorization, then to the extent Law permits, you waive that right.</p><h4 id="44-taxes">4.4    Taxes.</h4><p>Stripe’s fees exclude all Taxes, except as the Stripe Pricing Page states to the contrary. You have sole responsibility and liability for: </p><p>(a) determining which, if any, Taxes or fees apply to the sale of your products and services, acceptance of donations, or payments you make or receive in connection with your use of the Services; and </p><p>(b) assessing, collecting, reporting and remitting Taxes for your business. </p><p>If Stripe is required to withhold any Taxes, Stripe may deduct those Taxes from amounts otherwise owed to you and pay those Taxes to the appropriate taxing authority. If you are exempt from paying, or are otherwise eligible to pay a reduced rate on, those Taxes, you may provide to Stripe an original certificate that satisfies applicable legal requirements attesting to your tax-exempt status or reduced rate eligibility, in which case Stripe will not deduct the Taxes covered by the certificate. You must provide accurate information regarding your tax affairs as Stripe reasonably requests, and must promptly notify Stripe if any information that Stripe prepopulates is inaccurate or incomplete. Stripe may send documents to you and taxing authorities for transactions processed using the Services. Specifically, Law may require Stripe to file periodic informational returns with taxing authorities related to your use of the Services. Stripe may send tax-related information electronically to you. </p><h3 id="5-user-bank-accounts-funds">5.  User Bank Accounts; Funds.</h3><h4 id="51-user-bank-accounts-prohibition-on-grant-or-assignment">5.1    User Bank Accounts; Prohibition on Grant or Assignment.</h4><p>You must designate at least one User Bank Account in connection with the Services. Stripe may debit and credit a User Bank Account as described in this Agreement. You must not grant or assign to any third party any lien on or interest in funds that may be owed to you under this Agreement until the funds are deposited into a User Bank Account. </p><h4 id="52-holding-of-funds">5.2    Holding of Funds.</h4><p>To the extent Law and the applicable Financial Services Terms permit, Stripe and its applicable Affiliates may invest funds they hold into liquid investments. Stripe or its applicable Affiliates will (a) hold these investments separate from investments made with their own funds; and (b) own, and User will not receive, any earnings from these investments. Stripe's investment of funds will not affect or delay its payout obligations under this Agreement. </p><h4 id="53-regulated-money-transmission-stripe-status">5.3    Regulated Money Transmission; Stripe Status.</h4><p>Certain Services involve regulated money transmission under U.S. Law. To the extent that your use of the Services involves money transmission or other regulated services under U.S. Law, Stripe’s Affiliate, SPC, provides those regulated Services, and the SPC terms located on or accessible from the Stripe Legal Page will apply to you, unless the applicable Services Terms specify otherwise. Stripe is not a bank, and does not accept deposits.</p><h4 id="54-dormant-accounts">5.4    Dormant Accounts.</h4><p>If you leave any funds dormant in a Stripe Account and you do not instruct Stripe on where to send them, Stripe may deem the funds abandoned by you and deliver them to the appropriate Governmental Authority. However, if Law requires, Stripe will attempt to notify you before doing so. </p><h3 id="6-termination-suspension-survival">6.  Termination; Suspension; Survival.</h3><h4 id="61-termination">6.1    Termination.</h4><p>(a) <em>Your Termination</em>. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by closing your Stripe Account. To do so, you must open <a class="

If after termination you use the Services again, this Agreement will apply with an Effective Date that is the date on which you first use the Services again. </p><p>(b) <em>Stripe Termination</em>. Stripe may terminate this Agreement (or any part) or close your Stripe Account at any time for any or no reason (including if any event listed in Sections 6.2(a)–(i) of these General Terms occurs) by notifying you. In addition, Stripe may terminate this Agreement (or relevant part) for cause if Stripe exercises its right to suspend Services (including under Section 6.2 of these General Terms) and does not reinstate the suspended Services within 30 days.</p><p>(c) <em>Termination for Material Breach</em>. A party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to the other party if the other party materially breaches this Agreement, and if capable of cure, does not cure the breach within 10 days after receiving notice specifying the breach. If the material breach affects only certain Services, the non-breaching party may choose to terminate only the affected Services.</p><p>(d) <em>Effect on Other Agreements</em>. Unless stated to the contrary, termination of this Agreement will not affect any other agreement between the parties or their Affiliates.</p><h4 id="62-suspension">6.2    Suspension.</h4><p>Stripe may immediately suspend providing any or all Services to you, and your access to the Stripe Technology, if:</p><p>(a) Stripe believes it will violate any Law, Financial Services Terms or Governmental Authority requirement;</p><p>(b) a Governmental Authority or a Financial Partner requires or directs Stripe to do so;</p><p>(c) you do not update in a timely manner your implementation of the Services or Stripe Technology to the latest production version Stripe recommends or requires; </p><p>(d) you do not respond in a timely manner to Stripe’s request for User Information or do not provide Stripe adequate time to verify and process updated User Information; </p><p>(e) you breach this Agreement or any other agreement between the parties; </p><p>(f) you breach any Financial Services Terms; </p><p>(g) you enter an Insolvency Proceeding;</p><p>(h) Stripe believes that you are engaged in a business, trading practice or other activity that presents an unacceptable risk to Stripe; or </p><p>(i) Stripe believes that your use of the Services (i) is or may be harmful to Stripe or any third party; (ii) presents an unacceptable level of credit risk; (iii) increases, or may increase, the rate of fraud that Stripe observes; (iv) degrades, or may degrade, the security, stability or reliability of the Stripe services, Stripe Technology or any third party’s system (e.g., your involvement in a distributed denial of service attack); (v) enables or facilitates, or may enable or facilitate, illegal or prohibited transactions; or (vi) is or may be unlawful.</p><h4 id="63-survival">6.3    Survival.</h4><p>The following will survive termination of this Agreement: </p><p>(a) provisions that by their nature are intended to survive termination (including Sections 4, 7.2, 9.4, 11, 12 and 13 of these General Terms); and</p><p>(b) provisions that allocate risk, or limit or exclude a party’s liability, to the extent necessary to ensure that a party’s potential liability for acts and omissions that occur during the Term remains unchanged after this Agreement terminates.</p><h3 id="7-use-rights">7.  Use Rights.</h3><h4 id="71-use-of-services">7.1    Use of Services.</h4><p>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Stripe grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license during the Term to access the Documentation, and access and use the Stripe Technology, as long as your access and use is (a) solely as necessary to use the Services; (b) solely for your business purposes; and (c) in compliance with this Agreement and the Documentation. </p><h4 id="72-feedback">7.2    Feedback.</h4><p>During the Term, you and your Affiliates may provide Feedback to a Stripe Entity.

All Feedback is Stripe’s confidential information.</p><h4 id="73-marks-usage">7.3    Marks Usage.</h4><p>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each party grants to the other party and its Affiliates a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license during the Term to use the Marks of the grantor party or its Affiliate solely to identify Stripe as your service provider. Accordingly, Stripe and its Affiliates may use those Marks: </p><p>(a) on Stripe webpages and apps that identify Stripe’s customers; </p><p>(b) in Stripe sales/marketing materials and communications; and</p><p>(c) in connection with promotional activities to which the parties agree in writing.</p><p>When using Marks of a Stripe Entity, you must comply with the <a class="

Stripe Payments Services.</h3><p>These terms (“<strong>Stripe Payments Terms</strong>”) supplement the General Terms and govern your use of the Stripe Payments Services. </p><h3 id="2-your-business">2.  Your Business.</h3><p>You are solely responsible for the nature and quality of the goods and services you provide (or if you accept donations, the intended use of those donations), and for Transaction receipts, delivery, support, refunds, returns, and for all other ancillary services you provide to Customers. You are solely responsible for verifying each Customer’s identity, determining a Customer’s eligibility and authority to complete a Transaction, and all other issues related to your goods and services and business activities. </p><h3 id="3-payment-methods-and-transactions">3.  Payment Methods and Transactions.</h3><h4 id="31-acceptance-and-use-requirements">3.1    Acceptance and Use Requirements.</h4><p>As part of the Stripe Payments Services, you may accept payment from Customers using various Payment Methods by submitting Transactions to Stripe through the Stripe Technology. All Payment Methods have specific requirements for their acceptance and use. These requirements may be incorporated into the Stripe API and other Stripe Technology, and may be described in the Documentation, the Payment Method Rules and Payment Method Terms. You must comply with all of these acceptance and use requirements.</p><h4 id="32-payment-method-rules-and-payment-method-terms">3.2    Payment Method Rules and Payment Method Terms.</h4><p>Your acceptance and use of a Payment Method may be subject to Payment Method Rules, Payment Method Terms, or both. Using the Stripe Payments Services to accept a Payment Method or submit a Transaction constitutes your acceptance of the applicable Payment Method Rules and Payment Method Terms (if any). Payment Method Rules and Payment Method Terms are Financial Services Terms for purposes of this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between any provision of this Agreement and the Payment Method Rules or Payment Method Terms, the applicable Payment Method Rules or Payment Method Terms will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. The Payment Method Terms and Payment Method Rules may be amended from time to time. Your continuing use of the applicable Stripe Payments Services constitutes your agreement to those amended terms. </p><h4 id="33-acquirer-terms">3.3    Acquirer Terms.</h4><p>Some Payment Method Providers require that their Payment Methods be accepted only through a Payment Method Acquirer, which may be Stripe, its Affiliate, or a Financial Partner. Some of these Payment Method Providers, such as Visa and Mastercard, require you to enter into Acquirer Terms, which will (a) identify the Payment Method Acquirer responsible for Transactions using that Payment Method Provider’s Payment Method; and (b) establish a direct contractual relationship and terms between you and the Payment Method Acquirer, as those Acquirer Terms further describe. The Acquirer Terms, which are Financial Services Terms for purposes of this Agreement, describe the Payment Methods to which they apply, and when they go into effect. The Payment Method Acquirers for Visa and Mastercard Transactions are Cross River Bank, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, PNC Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.

Payment Method Providers and Payment Method Acquirers are Financial Partners for purposes of this Agreement. Payment Method Providers may enforce the terms of this Agreement directly against you with respect to that Payment Method Provider’s Payment Method(s). A Payment Method Provider or Payment Method Acquirer may terminate your ability to accept a Payment Method at any time and for any reason, in which case you will no longer be able to accept that Payment Method under this Agreement.

Processing Transactions.</h3><h4 id="41-payment-authorization-requests">4.1    Payment Authorization Requests.</h4><p>(a) <em>Processing Transactions.</em> To enable Stripe to process Transactions for you, you authorize and direct Stripe, its Affiliates, Payment Method Providers and Payment Method Acquirers to receive and settle, as applicable, settlement funds owed to you through your use of the Stripe Payments Services. You may only submit Transactions that Customers authorize, and only after the applicable goods have been shipped or services provided to the Customer; except, you may submit a Transaction before goods have been shipped or services have been provided to the Customer where the Customer has authorized a Transaction for a partial or full prepayment for goods or services to be provided at a future time, or you have obtained the Customer’s consent. </p><p>(b) <em>Transaction Responsibility</em>. You must not proceed with a Transaction if (i) you know or should have known that the Transaction was fraudulent, not authorized by the Customer, or illegal in your or your Customer’s jurisdiction; (ii) you receive a response declining to authorize the Transaction; or (iii) the Customer’s ability to use a Payment Method has expired or is no longer valid. You must not split payment for a single transaction into multiple Transactions except as the Payment Method Rules, Payment Method Terms and Acquirer Terms expressly permit. You must not submit any Transaction that duplicates a Transaction that is already subject to a Dispute, or was previously disputed and subsequently resolved in your favor. Stripe may refuse to process, or condition or suspend any Transaction that Stripe believes (x) may violate this Agreement or other agreement you have with Stripe (if any); (y) is unauthorized, fraudulent or illegal; or (z) exposes, or is likely to expose, Stripe, you or others to unacceptable risk.</p><h4 id="42-pooled-accounts">4.2    Pooled Accounts.</h4><p>You appoint Stripe and Stripe’s Affiliate, SPC, as your agents for the limited purpose of directing, receiving, holding and settling funds under this Agreement. All settlement funds Stripe or, as applicable, SPC receives for Transactions are combined with settlement funds for other users and held in one or more Pooled Accounts at one or more Financial Partners. Once Stripe or SPC (as applicable) receives funds for a Transaction on your behalf, the relevant Customer has no further obligation to make payments to you with respect to that Transaction, regardless of whether and when Stripe or SPC (as applicable) settles those funds to you. If Stripe or SPC (as applicable) does not settle funds due to you under this Agreement, you will have recourse only against Stripe or SPC (as applicable) and not the relevant Customer. Stripe will promptly update your Stripe Account balance to reflect processed Transactions. If, in the capacity as your agent, Stripe or its Affiliate provide a receipt for a Transaction to the applicable Customer, that receipt is binding on you. Stripe and its Affiliates (as applicable) may invest funds held in a Pooled Account as described in Section 5.2 of the General Terms. You have no rights to any Pooled Account, or earnings generated by funds held in any Pooled Account, and are not entitled to draw funds from any Pooled Account. </p><h4 id="43-transaction-settlement-funds">4.3    Transaction Settlement Funds.</h4><p>Stripe will transfer settlement funds for Transactions, net of Fees, Disputes, Refunds, Reversals and other amounts owed to Stripe, from the applicable Pooled Account to the applicable User Bank Account within the time period stated in the Payout Schedule, unless a Payout Delay occurs and affects the transfer initiation, or Stripe exercises a right under this Agreement to withhold or delay the transfer. However, Stripe may impose an additional holding period before making the initial settlement to a User Bank Account.</p><h4 id="44-sending-funds-to-third-party-recipients">4.4    Sending Funds to Third-Party Recipients.</h4><p>Stripe may offer you the ability to send to a third party funds owed to you as you instruct Stripe (including by sending all or part of the positive balance in your Stripe Account to that third-party recipient’s Stripe account or bank account), instead of settling funds to a User Bank Account. If Stripe or SPC sends funds to a third-party recipient which may include the use of a payment intermediary operating on your behalf, as this Section 4.4 contemplates, then Stripe’s and SPC’s obligations (and all applicable Payment Method Provider and Payment Method Acquirer obligations) to settle those funds to you are satisfied.</p><h4 id="45-settlement-fees">4.5    Settlement Fees.</h4><p>Stripe is not responsible for any fees imposed by banks to which Stripe transfers funds, including the banks that hold the User Bank Accounts and the third-party recipient accounts. </p><h4 id="46-subscriptions-and-invoicing">4.6    Subscriptions and Invoicing.</h4><p>If you use the Services to submit recurring or subscription Transactions, then before submitting the initial Transaction, you must (a) inform each Customer that the relevant Transactions will occur on an ongoing basis; and (b) explain the method for canceling the Customer’s recurring billing or subscription. If you use the Services to issue invoices to Customers, you must ensure that the form and content of the invoices comply with Law and are sufficient to achieve the legal or tax effects that you are trying to achieve.</p><h4 id="47-customer-authorizations">4.7    Customer Authorizations.</h4><p>If you use the Stripe Payments Services for certain Transactions where the Customer is not present, including MOTO Transactions or Merchant Initiated Transactions, or to store a Customer’s Payment Method for future use, you may be required by Law and Payment Method Rules to obtain the Customer’s authorization (also known as a mandate or agreement for the provision of products or services) and make certain disclosures to the Customer. These disclosures may include when, and under what circumstances, the Customer’s Payment Method will be charged, how the payment amount will be determined, and how future payments can be canceled. You must retain, and provide to Stripe upon request, records demonstrating that you have (a) obtained any required Customer authorizations in compliance with Law and Payment Method Rules; and (b) only submitted Transactions as MOTO Transactions or Merchant Initiated Transactions that you have determined are eligible. </p><h3 id="5-actions-stripe-may-take-in-processing-transactions">5.  Actions Stripe May Take in Processing Transactions.</h3><h4 id="51-reconciliation-and-responsibility">5.1    Reconciliation and Responsibility.</h4><p>As between the parties, and except as required by Law, you are responsible for reviewing your Transaction history for accuracy and completeness and reconciling your Transaction history with the history of transfers from the Pooled Accounts to the User Bank Accounts. If you find an error when you reconcile your Transaction history, Stripe will reasonably cooperate with you to investigate and help correct that error as long as you notify Stripe of the error within 60 days after the error appears in your Transaction history. Stripe may correct any errors in your Transaction history by crediting or debiting the User Bank Accounts.</p><h4 id="52-negative-balances">5.2    Negative Balances.</h4><p>If your Stripe Account balance (or the Stripe Account balance of any User Entity) is negative, or does not contain funds sufficient to pay amounts that you (or a User Entity) owe to a Stripe Entity or Customers, then without limiting Stripe’s rights under Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the General Terms, Stripe may debit the User Bank Accounts by the amount necessary to collect, and pay out to Customers if applicable, the amounts you owe. </p><h4 id="53-disputes-refunds-reversals">5.3    Disputes; Refunds; Reversals.</h4><p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, you are liable to Stripe for the full amount of all Disputes (unless and until a Dispute is resolved to final disposition in your favor according to applicable Payment Method Rules and as described in the Documentation), Refunds and Reversals regardless of the reason or timing.</p><p>(a) <em>Disputes</em>. Stripe may delay or withhold paying out a Transaction amount from funds owed to you if Stripe reasonably believes that a Dispute is likely to occur with respect to that Transaction. Stripe may delay or withhold paying out amounts subject to an actual Dispute until the Payment Method Provider resolves the Dispute.</p><p>(b) <em>Refunds</em>. If you intend to issue a Refund to a Customer, you must initiate a Refund instruction via the Services within 5 days after informing the Customer of your intention. Stripe may refuse to act upon a Refund instruction, or delay executing the instruction, if you are the subject of an Insolvency Proceeding, it would cause a negative balance in your Stripe Account or if Stripe believes that there is a risk you will not meet your liabilities under this Agreement.</p><p>(c) <em>Reversals</em>. Without limiting Stripe’s rights under Sections 5.4 - 5.6 of these Stripe Payments Terms, Stripe may initiate a Reversal if: </p><p>(i) the Payment Method Provider invalidates the Transaction; </p><p>(ii)    you receive funds in error for any reason; </p><p>(iii)   you were not authorized to accept the Transaction; </p><p>(iv)    you receive funds related to activities that violate this Agreement, Law or Financial Services Terms; or </p><p>(v) a Payment Method Provider or Payment Method Acquirer requires Stripe to do so under the applicable Financial Services Terms. </p><h4 id="54-stripe-remedies-specific-triggers">5.4    Stripe Remedies – Specific Triggers.</h4><p>Stripe may exercise any or all of the remedies stated in Section 5.6 of these Stripe Payments Terms if Stripe determines that a User Entity:</p><p>(a) has incurred or is likely to incur excessive Disputes, Refunds or Reversals; </p><p>(b) has submitted one or more Transactions for goods or services not immediately deliverable to the Customer without first obtaining Stripe’s consent;</p><p>(c) has a negative Stripe Account balance; </p><p>(d) has experienced or is likely to experience a change in the average time between the initial charge and fulfillment of Customer orders that Stripe considers to be material; </p><p>(e) is or is likely to become the subject of an Insolvency Proceeding;</p><p>(f) has experienced or is likely to experience a deterioration of its business or financial condition that Stripe considers to be material;</p><p>(g) has breached or is likely to breach, or has caused or is likely to cause Stripe to breach, this Agreement (or any other Stripe services agreement with a Stripe Entity) or the Financial Services Terms applicable to the User Entity’s use of the Services; </p><p>(h) has violated or is likely to violate Law or Financial Services Terms;</p><p>(i) has caused or is likely to cause Stripe to violate Law or Financial Services Terms;</p><p>(j) has experienced or is likely to experience a Change of Control; </p><p>(k) has, either itself or by way of its employees, agents, directors or contractors, initiated Transactions or undertaken any other action that is or is likely to be fraudulent, suspicious or involve criminal activity;</p><p>(l) has, without Stripe’s prior consent, changed its business model (including services supplied by a User Entity to its customers), exposing Stripe to increased risk; or</p><p>(m) has acted in a manner or engaged in business, trading practice or other activity that presents an unacceptable risk.</p><h4 id="55-stripe-remedies-general-trigger">5.5    Stripe Remedies – General Trigger.</h4><p>Stripe may exercise any or all of the remedies stated in Section 5.6 of these Stripe Payments Terms if (a) Stripe reasonably determines that Stripe may incur losses resulting from credit, fraud, criminal activity or other risks associated with a User Entity after these Stripe Payments Terms terminate; or (b) Law requires.</p><h4 id="56-stripe-remedies-scope">5.6    Stripe Remedies – Scope.</h4><p>Stripe may, in accordance with Sections 5.4 and 5.5 of these Stripe Payments Terms:</p><p>(a) initiate Reversals; </p><p>(b) change the Payout Schedule or delay or cancel the payout of funds to the User Bank Accounts; </p><p>(c) establish, fund and use a Reserve; </p><p>(d) debit the User Bank Accounts or the bank or financial institution accounts of any or all User Entities; </p><p>(e) suspend or terminate your ability to accept or process Transactions;</p><p>(f) refuse to (i) process Transactions, and (ii) act upon Refund instructions; and</p><p>(g) setoff or recoup all liability that Stripe reasonably determines a User Entity owes to a Stripe Entity under this Agreement or another agreement, against any amounts that a Stripe Entity, owes to a User Entity whether the liability is matured, unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated.</p><h4 id="57-reserve">5.7    Reserve.</h4><p>If Stripe establishes a Reserve, Stripe will notify you of the Reserve terms. Stripe may change the Reserve terms (a) if Stripe believes that there is, or is likely to be, a change in the underlying risk presented by the User Group’s use of Stripe services; or (b) as a Payment Method Acquirer or Payment Method Provider requires. You have no legal or equitable right or interest in any Reserve, in the funds held in any Reserve, or earnings generated by funds held in any Reserve, and are not entitled to draw funds from any Reserve. If you become subject to an Insolvency Proceeding, funds held in a Reserve will not be part of any estate created in connection with that Insolvency Proceeding. Stripe may fund the Reserve through any or all of: </p><p>(x) using funds you provide upon Stripe’s request; </p><p>(y) using funds that a Stripe Entity owes to any User Entity for Transactions that the User Group accepts through the Stripe Payments Services; or </p><p>(z) debiting the User Bank Accounts or the bank or financial institution accounts of any or all User Entities.</p><h4 id="58-security-interest">5.8    Security Interest.</h4><p>You grant Stripe a lien on and security interest in your interest, if any, in (a) all funds owed to you for Transactions (including funds owed to you for future Transactions and all funds that Stripe holds on your behalf); and (b) all rights to receive credits and payments under this Agreement. You must execute all documents and provide all authorizations that Stripe reasonably requests for the purpose of creating, perfecting (including filing relevant documents), maintaining and enforcing this lien and security interest, even if the request is made after your Stripe Account balance becomes negative. </p><h4 id="59-credit-support-requirement">5.9    Credit Support Requirement.</h4><p>Stripe may require that you provide a guarantee (including a personal, parent or bank guarantee) or letter of credit in a form and substance that satisfies Stripe. In this event, Stripe will inform you of the amount of and the reasons for the requirement. If you are unable to satisfy the requirement when Stripe requires you to do so, Stripe may suspend or terminate your access to the Services.</p><h3 id="6-multi-currency-processing">6.  Multi-Currency Processing.</h3><p>Stripe may offer Multi-Currency Processing. To use Multi-Currency Processing, you must provide to Stripe a valid bank account for each currency for which you request settlement, based on the list of available settlement currencies stated in the Documentation. Each of these bank accounts is a User Bank Account for the purposes of this Agreement. If you use Multi-Currency Processing, Stripe will identify at the time of each applicable Transaction the conversion rate that will apply to the Transaction. In the event of a Refund, the conversion rate that will be used to calculate the Refund will be the rate in effect at the time of the Refund.</p><h3 id="7-post-termination-obligations">7.  Post-Termination Obligations.</h3><h4 id="71-completion-of-transactions">7.1    Completion of Transactions.</h4><p>Following termination of these Stripe Payments Terms, you must fulfill your obligations related to existing Transactions, not accept new Transactions via the Services, and remove all Marks of a Stripe Entity or a Financial Partner from your website (unless permitted under a separate license with the applicable Financial Partner). Stripe will complete Transactions initiated before termination as long as Stripe would have completed those Transactions were these Stripe Payments Terms still in place (e.g., Stripe will not complete a Transaction if a Financial Partner prohibits Stripe from doing so). Termination does not affect your responsibility for Transactions described in Section 3 of these Stripe Payments Terms. </p><h4 id="72-provision-of-payment-account-details">7.2    Provision of Payment Account Details.</h4><p>If these Stripe Payments Terms terminate for reasons other than your breach, then within 30 days after the termination date, you may request in writing that Stripe provide all relevant Payment Account Details to an alternative PCI-DSS Level 1-certified payment processor that you identify to Stripe. Stripe will provide the Payment Account Details that you are entitled to receive to the named payment processor to the extent commercially reasonable. Stripe may delay or refuse any request if Stripe believes the payment processor you have identified does not have systems or controls in place that are sufficient to protect Payment Account Details, that the integrity of Payment Account Details may be compromised, or that Law or Financial Services Terms do not allow Stripe to provide the Payment Account Details. </p><h3 id="8-user-information-updates">8.  User Information Updates.</h3><p>You must immediately notify Stripe, and provide to Stripe updated User Information, if you experience or anticipate experiencing a material change in the average time between the initial charge and fulfillment of Customer orders. Upon request, you must promptly provide to Stripe information related to Transactions and Disputes, including (a) refund and shipping policies (if applicable); (b) data on captured but unfulfilled charges; and (c) data on the time between charge capture and fulfillment of Customer orders.</p><h3 id="9-pci-standards-compliance">9.  PCI Standards Compliance.</h3><p>If you elect to store or hold "Account Data," as defined in the PCI Standards (including Customer card account number or expiration date), you must maintain a system that complies with the PCI Standards and upon Stripe’s request, you must provide to Stripe evidence of your compliance. If you do not comply with the PCI Standards, or if Stripe or any Payment Method Provider or Payment Method Acquirer is unable to verify your compliance with the PCI Standards, Stripe may suspend your Stripe Account or terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part. If you intend to use a third-party service provider to store or transmit Payment Account Details (including Customer card account number and expiration date) then you must not share any Payment Account Details with the service provider until you verify that the third party holds sufficient certifications under the PCI Standards, and must <a class="

Representations and Warranties.</h3><p>You represent as of the Effective Date, and warrant during the Term, that (a) you only use the Payment Methods and Stripe Payments Services for bona fide commercial transactions (which must be free of liens, claims, and encumbrances other than ordinary sales taxes) for the sale of goods or services to, or other act with, Customers; (b) except as Stripe approves, you do not use the Stripe Payments Services for intercompany transactions; (c) you fulfill all of your obligations to Customers; and (d) you and your third-party service providers that store, access or transmit Payment Account Details comply with the PCI Standards, as applicable.</p><h3 id="11-indemnification">11.

  "><p>Last modified: December 15, 2023</p><h3 id="1-stripe-connect-services">1.  Stripe Connect Services.</h3><p>These terms (“<strong>Stripe Connect Terms</strong>”) supplement the General Terms and the Stripe Payments Terms and govern your use of the Stripe Connect Services as a Stripe Connect Platform. You may use the Stripe Connect Services to (a) enable your Platform Users to use Stripe Services in conjunction with your Platform Services; and (b) make payouts to Payout Recipients, and by doing so, you will be using Stripe Payments Services. </p><h3 id="2-stripe-obligations">2.  Stripe Obligations.</h3><h4 id="21-connected-accounts">2.1    Connected Accounts.</h4><p>Connected Accounts may use the Services in accordance with the Connected Account Agreement. Stripe may suspend or stop providing any Services to (a) a Payout Recipient for any reason; and (b) a Custom Account, Express Account or Standard Account in accordance with the terms of the Connected Account Agreement. Except for Connected Accounts that are Payout Recipients, Stripe has a direct contractual relationship with each Connected Account under the Connected Account Agreement and will provide the Services directly to each Connected Account. You acknowledge that Connected Accounts may choose to use Stripe services outside of the Connected Accounts’ relationship with you.</p><h4 id="22-amendments-to-connected-account-agreement">2.2    Amendments to Connected Account Agreement.</h4><p>For Custom Accounts and Express Accounts, Stripe will notify you if Stripe modifies the relevant Connected Account Agreement. You must notify those Connected Accounts (excluding Payout Recipients) of the modification promptly after you receive the modification notice from Stripe.</p><h4 id="23-definitions-applied-to-connected-accounts-general-terms-clarification">2.3    Definitions Applied to Connected Accounts; General Terms Clarification.</h4><p>Where defined terms are applied to a Connected Account (rather than you) in these terms, the relevant definition will be deemed to reference the Connected Account (e.g., when the term Services is applied to a Connected Account it means the Stripe services that Stripe makes available to the Connected Account under the Connected Account Agreement, and when the term Disputes is applied to a Connected Account it means Disputes that Connected Account incurs). Connected Accounts are not third parties for the purposes of, or eligible to make a Claim under, Section 11 of the General Terms.</p><h3 id="3-your-obligations">3.  Your Obligations.</h3><h4 id="31-stripe-connect-services-integration-and-use">3.1    Stripe Connect Services Integration and Use.</h4><p>You must integrate the Stripe API and use the Stripe Connect Services in accordance with the Documentation and this Agreement. You must use the Stripe Connect Services and Connected Account Data in accordance with Law and your Platform Provider Agreement. You must clearly and prominently disclose all fees, if any, that you may charge to Connected Accounts for the Connected Accounts' use of your Platform Services and, to the extent charged separately, the Services. </p><h4 id="32-connected-accounts-and-transactional-risk">3.2    Connected Accounts and Transactional Risk.</h4><p>You must ensure that Connected Accounts do not use the Services in breach of the Connected Account Agreement or for any activity that Law or this Agreement prohibits. You must immediately inform Stripe if you become aware that a Connected Account is engaging in any activity that is fraudulent, deceptive or harmful, or in breach of the Connected Account Agreement or this Agreement. You must cooperate with Stripe to reduce the risk of fraud or other misuse of the Services, including by providing relevant information to Stripe. </p><h4 id="33-restricted-businesses">3.3    Restricted Businesses.</h4><p>You must ensure that no Connected Account uses the Services to conduct a Restricted Business or transact with a Restricted Business.</p><h4 id="34-activity">3.4    Activity.</h4><p>A Connected Account may perform Activity, or you may perform Activity on behalf of a Connected Account, depending on how you integrate the Stripe API into your Platform Services. You are responsible for all Activity initiated by you, your representatives, and any individual or entity using your credentials, including your Stripe Account login and password and your Stripe API key. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, where either Stripe or a Connected Account incurs any losses, damages or costs based on unauthorized Activity initiated by you or on your behalf, then as between Stripe and you, you are liable for those losses, damages or costs. </p><h4 id="35-your-agreements-with-connected-accounts">3.5    Your Agreements with Connected Accounts.</h4><p>Your Platform Provider Agreement must explain how you access and use Connected Account Data, and the Activity that you may conduct on the Connected Accounts’ behalf via the Stripe Connect Services. Your Platform Provider Agreement must also authorize you to perform that Activity, and to share the Connected Account Data with Stripe. </p><h4 id="36-limitations">3.6    Limitations.</h4><p>You must not use the Stripe Connect Services to access any Connected Account Data or conduct any Activity, or attempt to do either, for which the relevant Connected Account has not authorized, or has withdrawn the authorization.</p><h3 id="4-stripe-connected-account-options">4.  Stripe Connected Account Options.</h3><h4 id="41-platform-account-options">4.1    Platform Account Options.</h4><p>You may elect to enroll each Platform User as a Standard Account, Express Account, or Custom Account. Depending on your enrollment election, you may (a) assist your Platform Users in creating Stripe accounts or integrating their existing Stripe accounts into your Platform Services; and (b) prepopulate or provide Connected Account Data during the enrollment process. Section 8 of the General Terms applies to all Connected Account Data that you prepopulate or provide to Stripe. Stripe may refuse to create a Stripe account for a Platform User or limit the functionality available to a Platform User until Stripe is satisfied that it has received sufficient information about that Platform User.</p><h4 id="42-standard-accounts">4.2    Standard Accounts.</h4><p>This Section 4.2 only applies to Standard Accounts. </p><p>(a) <em>Enrollment.</em> For Standard Accounts, you will have access to certain Connected Account Data. Stripe may require you to collect and provide additional Connected Account Data to validate a Standard Account.</p><p>(b) <em>Termination.</em> A Standard Account may at any time terminate your ability to conduct Activity on its Stripe account. </p><h4 id="43-custom-accounts-and-express-accounts">4.3    Custom Accounts and Express Accounts.</h4><p>This Section 4.3 only applies to Custom Accounts and Express Accounts.</p><p>(a) <em>Enrollment.</em> You must create and manage the Stripe accounts for Custom Accounts and Express Accounts. You must ensure that Connected Account Data is passed to Stripe in the manner prescribed in the Documentation.</p><p>(b) <em>Connected Account Agreement for Custom Accounts.</em> You must ensure that each Platform User that you intend to onboard as a Custom Account agrees to the Connected Account Agreement before it uses any Stripe services. At Stripe’s request, you must provide proof as Stripe requires that these agreements have been entered into between the Custom Accounts and Stripe. If Stripe believes that your existing acceptance process does not create a binding agreement between Stripe and each Custom Account, then, upon Stripe’s request, you must modify that process as Stripe requires.</p><p>(c) <em>Stripe Dashboard.</em> Custom Accounts will not have access to a Stripe Dashboard.</p><p>(d) <em>Responsibility for Custom Accounts and Express Accounts.</em> You are responsible and liable to Stripe for all Activity on Custom Accounts and Express Accounts, whether initiated by you or not, including all Transactions, Disputes, Refunds, Reversals, associated fines, and any use of the Services in a manner prohibited under this Agreement or the Connected Account Agreement. You and the relevant Connected Account are jointly and severally liable to Stripe for amounts the Connected Account owes to Stripe, and Stripe may collect these amounts from you in accordance with this Agreement. If Stripe determines that your responsibility for Activity on Custom Accounts and Express Accounts creates an unacceptable risk to Stripe, Stripe may exercise its remedies listed in Section 5.6 of the Stripe Payments Terms.</p><h4 id="44-payout-recipients">4.4    Payout Recipients.</h4><p>Stripe may enable you to make payouts to Payout Recipients. For the purpose of these payouts, Stripe does not provide any service directly to the Payout Recipients, and the Payout Recipients do not have a contractual or business relationship with Stripe. To the extent Stripe makes payouts to Payout Recipients, it does so on your behalf. To receive these payouts, Payout Recipients will not enter into a Connected Account Agreement and that concept, as used in these Stripe Connect Terms, will not apply to Connected Accounts that are Payout Recipients. You must complete a Stripe account application for each Payout Recipient and enroll them as a Custom or an Express Account. Each Payout Recipient is subject to Stripe’s approval. You must ensure that each Payout Recipient receives the Stripe Recipient Notice before you make a payout to the Payout Recipient.</p><h3 id="5-tax-reporting-tax-invoicing">5.  Tax Reporting; Tax Invoicing.</h3><h4 id="51-filing-of-tax-information-reports">5.1    Filing of Tax Information Reports.</h4><p>Unless Stripe notifies you otherwise, Stripe will not file any, and you assume sole responsibility and liability for filing all, Tax Information Reports required to be filed as a result of Services Stripe provides to you under this Agreement or to Connected Accounts under their Connected Account Agreement; but Stripe will file Tax Information Reports with respect to payments made to Standard Accounts. </p><h4 id="52-indemnity">5.2    Indemnity.</h4><p>You will indemnify Stripe from all Taxes, and related interest, penalties and fees (excluding any income, franchise or similar taxes payable with respect to the Fees), if any, imposed on a Stripe Entity as a result of your failure to timely file any Tax Information Report under Section 5.1 of these Stripe Connect Terms.</p><h4 id="53-issuing-tax-information-reports">5.3    Issuing Tax Information Reports.</h4><p>For Standard Accounts, Stripe will issue required Tax Information Reports directly to Standard Accounts under their Connected Account Agreement. For Custom Accounts and Express Accounts, Stripe will issue Tax Information Reports (if applicable) directly to you only.</p><h4 id="54-tax-invoices">5.4    Tax Invoices.</h4><p>For Standard Accounts, Stripe will issue Tax invoices, as applicable, to: (a) you under these Stripe Connect Terms, (b) Standard Accounts under their Connected Account Agreement, or (c) both you and the Standard Accounts. For Custom Accounts and Express Accounts, Stripe will issue Tax invoices (if applicable) to you only.</p><h3 id="6-data-use">6.  Data Use.</h3><p>Each party may use Connected Account Data in accordance with this Agreement and any consent or agreement it obtains from each Connected Account, which, as to Stripe, includes the Connected Account Agreement. You must provide all notices and obtain all necessary rights and consents for Stripe to lawfully process Connected Account Data as you instruct. Stripe may refuse to process Connected Account Data as you instruct if Stripe reasonably believes complying with your instructions would require Stripe to violate Law or the Connected Account Agreement.  </p><h3 id="7-your-liability-for-custom-accounts-and-express-accounts">7.  Your Liability for Custom Accounts and Express Accounts.</h3><p><strong>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, your liability for Custom Accounts and Express Accounts as described in these Stripe Connect Terms, including liability arising out of or relating to your failure to ensure that each Custom Account agreed to the Connected Account Agreement in a legally binding way, is not limited or excluded in any way.</strong></p></div>

  "><p>Last modified: November 20, 2023</p><p>These Stripe Climate Commitment terms (“Climate Commitment Terms”) and Stripe Climate Orders terms (“Climate Orders Terms”) (collectively, the “Terms”) supplement the General Terms, and govern your use of Stripe Climate Commitment and Stripe Climate Orders. Frontier Climate Operations, LLC (“Frontier”), Stripe’s Affiliate, provides Stripe Climate Orders. For purposes of Stripe Climate Orders, each reference to "Stripe" in the General Terms will be read as a reference to Frontier.</p><h3 id="1-overview">1. Overview</h3><p>Stripe conducts research into Climate Projects and purchases carbon removal services.  You may make voluntary contributions to Climate Projects through Stripe Climate Commitment. Frontier uses Offtake Agreements to acquire Carbon Removal Units. You may verify the availability of, and purchase Retirement Services through Stripe Climate Orders. </p><h3 id="2-stripe-climate-commitment-terms">2. Stripe Climate Commitment Terms</h3><h4 id="21-opting-in-and-out-and-changes">2.1 Opting In and Out, and Changes.</h4><p>You must opt in to make a contribution during onboarding or via the Stripe Climate Commitment page of your Stripe Dashboard You may opt out of, change, or pause your contribution to Stripe Climate Commitment at any time in your Stripe Dashboard.</p><h4 id="22-climate-commitment-funds">2.2 Climate Commitment Funds.</h4><p>(a) Climate Commitment Funds Allocation.</p><p>Once you opt in, Stripe or its Affiliate may deduct the Climate Commitment Funds from your Stripe Account balance or User Bank Account on a per-Transaction basis, or as an amount aggregated over a period of time, as described in your Stripe Dashboard. Stripe will allocate all Climate Commitment Funds to advance the field of carbon removal, through activities such as purchasing metric tons of carbon removal, or funding research and development for new carbon removal technologies. Climate Commitment Funds are not refundable.</p><p>(b) Stripe Climate Commitment Goals.</p><p>The goal of Stripe Climate Commitment is to help advance the field of carbon removal and Climate Commitment Funds will be used in support of that goal. While Stripe will use reasonable efforts to fund impactful Climate Projects, companies receiving Climate Commitment Funds are developing new technology in an evolving industry and their survival and success in addressing climate issues are not guaranteed. Development timelines of many new technologies are long, the resulting impact may not be immediate, and there is always a risk that the chosen technologies fail to deliver any carbon removal. Even if they are eventually successful in obtaining results, Climate Projects may take years to produce those results.</p><p>(c) Use of Climate Commitment Funds.</p><p>You decide voluntarily whether to, and in what amount, to allocate Climate Commitment Funds. Stripe may choose not to use your Climate Commitment Funds immediately after deducting them from your Stripe Account; rather, Stripe may allocate them after Stripe identifies a Climate Project. Stripe will inform you regularly about how Climate Commitment Funds were allocated. Stripe will not apply Climate Commitment Funds toward its own corporate or administrative costs.</p><p>(d) No Carbon Credits.</p><p>The carbon removal services Stripe purchases are not certified by any governmental or non-governmental body. They are not “authorized” under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Stripe disclaims all warranties regarding (i) the status under applicable governmental or non-governmental programs or pursuant to standards set by governmental or non-governmental bodies, whether implemented now or in the future, (ii) the availability of any current or future tax credit, benefit, or treatment, or (iii) any other financial benefits, associated with  the carbon removal services that Stripe purchases.</p><p>(e) Taxes.</p><p>The Climate Commitment Funds you allocate may not be eligible for a tax deduction. You should consult with your tax or legal advisor on the local tax treatment of allocated Climate Commitment Funds. Climate Commitment Funds exclude all Taxes, except as the Documentation states to the contrary.</p><h3 id="3-stripe-climate-orders-terms">3. Stripe Climate Orders Terms</h3><h4 id="31-your-use-of-stripe-climate-orders">3.1. Your Use of Stripe Climate Orders.</h4><p>You must only use Stripe Climate Orders in compliance with these Stripe Climate Orders Terms. You must use the Stripe Climate Orders for business purposes only, which must be consistent with the business purpose descriptions you provided to Stripe at the time of onboarding and updated at any time thereafter. You may not use the Stripe Climate Orders for personal, family, or household use. </p><h4 id="32-crus">3.2. CRUs.</h4><p>(a) Frontier uses Offtake Agreements to acquire CRUs, as further described on the Frontier Webpage. To the extent commercially reasonable, Frontier will review (i) the sources of CRUs; and (ii) the terms governing the generation of those CRUs.</p><p>(b) Frontier will make Retirement Services available to you for purchase subject to: (i) the availability of CRUs in carbon markets; (ii) Frontier’s ability to secure all necessary rights (including contractual rights) for the future delivery of the CRUs; and (iii) Frontier’s receipt of those CRUs. You may verify the availability of CRUs for Retirement, and purchase Retirement Services using the Climate API or the Dashboard.  While Frontier will provide you with information about the CRUs available for Retirement, it is your responsibility to verify that the CRUs meet your needs or the needs of a Beneficiary.</p><p>(c) Frontier may be unable to acquire sufficient quantities of CRUs to fulfill orders for Retirement Services. The CRU(s) that Frontier ultimately Retires on your behalf may have been generated from an Offtake Agreement that Frontier executed after your initial purchase. In order to provide Retirement Services, Frontier reserves the right to: (i) substitute CRUs from any one carbon removal supplier with a CRU from a different carbon removal supplier; or (ii) allocate then-current inventory of CRUs among Purchasers. </p><p>(d) The CRUs are not “authorized” under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Frontier disclaims all warranties regarding (i) the status of CRUs under applicable governmental or non-governmental programs or pursuant to standards set by governmental or non-governmental bodies, whether implemented now or in the future, (ii) the availability of any current or future tax credit, benefit, or treatment, or (iii) any other financial benefits, associated with your purchase of Retirement Services or the associated CRU(s).</p><h4 id="33-retirement">3.3. Retirement.</h4><p>(a) On or before the last day of the Retirement Year, Frontier: (i) on your behalf, will Retire the CRU; or (ii) if applicable, will transfer title to the CRU to you. If you have designated a Beneficiary, Frontier will Retire the CRU on that Beneficiary’s behalf and include the Beneficiary’s name in the Registry, if permitted. Frontier will Retire and record the CRU in the applicable Registry in accordance with and subject to the rules of that Registry. </p><p>(b) Frontier may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, Retire and record partial CRUs (i.e., partial tons) with a Registry. Frontier may combine partial CRUs and record them in Frontier’s name.</p><p>(c) If Frontier Retires a CRU on your behalf or on behalf of a Beneficiary, Frontier will notify you of the Retirement via the Climate API, the Dashboard, or, if applicable, by other means you elect in the Dashboard, and deliver a certificate to you evidencing Retirement. Certificates will be digital.</p><p>(d) In the event Frontier does not receive sufficient CRUs to fulfill all orders for Retirement Services, Frontier reserves the right, in its sole discretion: (i) to allocate CRUs among Purchasers; or (ii) refund the Fees. </p><p>(e) If Frontier determines that it is unable to Retire a CRU in your name or in the Beneficiary’s name on or prior to the last day of the Retirement Year of the CRU, Frontier will notify you and, in its sole discretion: (i) may refund the applicable Fees; (ii) may transfer title to the CRU to you; (iii) may record the Retirement of the CRU in Frontier’s name and provide certification to you that Frontier completed the Retirement in Frontier’s name; or (iv) take other reasonable remedial measures. Neither Frontier nor Stripe will pay you any interest on Fees, and Frontier will have no further obligation to you regarding that Retirement and the associated CRU(s) nor any other obligation to complete any additional Retirements. Frontier will not be liable to you for any other losses, damages, or costs that you or others may suffer arising out of or relating to Frontier’s inability to perform the Retirement Services or the associated CRU.  </p><p>(f) If Frontier is unable to contact you, or is unable to provide a refund of Fees, for any reason (e.g., you have closed your Stripe Account), Frontier will contribute any amounts due to you to carbon removal programs of its choosing.</p><p>(g) Frontier will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure a CRU can be Retired on your behalf or on behalf of your designated Beneficiary. Frontier does not guarantee that Frontier will be able to Retire a CRU on behalf of a Beneficiary.  </p><h4 id="34-beneficiaries">3.4. Beneficiaries.</h4><p>You may designate a Beneficiary when you purchase Retirement Services. If permitted by the applicable Registry, Frontier will include the Beneficiary’s name when retiring CRUs. You are responsible for notifying a Beneficiary of a CRU’s Retirement. Frontier will not notify a Beneficiary of a CRU’s Retirement.  These Stripe Climate Orders Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties to these Stripe Climate Orders Terms. Frontier has no obligation to any Beneficiary under these Stripe Climate Orders Terms. When you designate a Beneficiary, you will not provide Frontier with a Beneficiary’s Personal Data. </p><h4 id="35-power-of-attorney">3.5. Power of Attorney.</h4><p>To the extent necessary, you grant to Frontier a power of attorney to act on your behalf or on behalf of a Beneficiary to provide Stripe Climate Orders. You represent as of the Effective Date and warrant during the Term that you have secured the necessary rights and consents from the applicable Beneficiaries to enable Frontier to act on behalf of the applicable Beneficiaries.</p><h4 id="36-suspension-and-termination">3.6. Suspension and Termination.</h4><p>Frontier may suspend or terminate at any time for any reason your access to Stripe Climate Orders, including your ability to advertise or publicize any CRUs or Stripe Climate Orders.</p><h4 id="37-fees">3.7. Fees.</h4><p>The Fees are stated on the Stripe Pricing Page. Fees payable for Stripe Climate Orders (including the Climate API and any other technology services related to Stripe Climate Orders) will be determined under the General Terms.</p><h4 id="38-frontier-intellectual-property">3.8. Frontier Intellectual Property.</h4><p>(a) Subject to the terms herein, Frontier grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license during the Term to access and use the Climate API and Frontier Marketing Collateral, as long as your access and use is (i) solely as necessary to use Stripe Climate Orders, (ii) solely for your business purposes, and (iii) in compliance with these Terms and the Documentation.</p><p>(b) As between you and Frontier, Frontier or its licensors exclusively own and retain all IP Rights embodied by, or contained in Stripe Climate Orders, frontierclimate.com, and other sites operated for Frontier (such IP Rights, collectively, “Frontier IP”). Frontier IP is protected by copyright, trade secret, patent, and other intellectual property laws, and all rights in Frontier IP not expressly granted to you in these Terms are reserved. </p><p>(c) During the Term, you and your Affiliates  may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments, feedback, or ideas about improvements to Stripe Climate Orders (“Feedback”). You grant, on behalf of yourself and your Affiliates, to Frontier and its Affiliates a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use that Feedback for any purpose, including developing, improving, manufacturing, promoting, selling and maintaining Stripe Climate Orders. All Feedback is Frontier’s confidential information. All improvements to Stripe Climate Orders belong to Frontier.</p><p>(d) As a user of Stripe Climate Orders, Frontier may provide you with digital assets (including digital assets owned by a third party, “Digital Assets”) that you may display on your website or otherwise use to promote CRUs available via Stripe Climate Orders.

At Frontier or Stripe’s request, you must permit and cooperate with Frontier or Stripe, as applicable, or its third-party auditor in connection with an audit of your compliance with this Agreement, and must provide any reasonably requested information or assistance.</p><h4 id="39-disclaimer">3.9.

Stripe Climate Orders are provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” to the fullest extent permissible by Law and other than as provided herein, Frontier and its Affiliates, and their employees, agents, and independent contractors (the “Disclaiming Entities”) make no representation or warranty of any kind whatsoever for Stripe Climate Orders or a CRU, including the availability of a CRU at any given time or the validity of a CRU’s generation. Frontier is not liable to you for losses, damages, or costs that you or others may suffer arising out of or relating to Frontier’s inability to Retire a CRU on your or on your Beneficiary’s behalf.

Stripe Treasury Services.</h3><p>These terms (“<strong>Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms</strong>”) supplement the General Terms and govern your use of the Stripe Treasury Services as a Stripe Treasury Accountholder. If you are a Stripe Connect Platform using the Stripe Treasury Services for your own business purposes, these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms apply to you as a Stripe Treasury Accountholder, and references to “Stripe Connect Platform” in these terms are also references to you.</p><h3 id="2-use-of-the-stripe-treasury-services">2.  Use of the Stripe Treasury Services.</h3><h4 id="21-scope">2.1    Scope.</h4><p>Stripe Treasury Services are money transmission services, and SPC is a licensed money transmitter and registered money services business, as defined under the Treasury Regulatory Requirements. You must reside in the Stripe Treasury Territory to use the Stripe Treasury Services. Your Stripe Connect Platform will provide you access to the Stripe Treasury Services (if applicable). Subject to the Treasury Regulatory Requirements and these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms, you and your Treasury Authorized Users will be able to (a) add funds to your Financial Account via ACH, wire transfer and other supported funding methods; and (b) transfer funds from your Financial Account to any account able to receive ACH or wire transfers at any financial institution.</p><h4 id="22-acknowledgments">2.2.   Acknowledgments.</h4><p>You acknowledge that:</p><p>(a)     SPC and its Affiliates are not banks;</p><p>(b)     the Financial Account is a virtual prepaid account and is not a demand deposit (checking) account, savings account, or other asset or bank account with SPC, an Affiliate of SPC, a Treasury Bank or an Affiliate of a Treasury Bank;</p><p>(c)     SPC will act as your agent with respect to the Financial Account;</p><p>(d)     SPC will select the Treasury Bank through which your Financial Account is created;</p><p>(e)     SPC makes no representation about the sufficiency of the capitalization of the Treasury Bank where your funds are held;</p><p>(f)     SPC may appoint Stripe as its agent or service provider to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms, other than with respect to money transmission services; and</p><p>(g)     your use of the Stripe Treasury Services may be subject to additional terms specific to your Stripe Connect Platform, which your Stripe Connect Platform will provide at the time you request access to the Stripe Treasury Services.</p><h3 id="3-ach-access">3   ACH Access.</h3><p>(a)   Under the Nacha Operating Rules, you are the Originator of the Entries you originate via your Financial Account. You must (a) obtain the consent of each of your payors and payees in compliance with the Nacha Operating Rules before originating an Entry over the ACH Network to debit or credit their account; and (b) maintain the security and integrity of all information you collect in the course of making an Entry. SPC may suspend your access to the ACH Network if you originate an Entry that results in a dispute or unauthorized Financial Account Transaction.</p><p>(b)   Your rights and obligations concerning any credit Entry transmitted via the ACH Network are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. Credit given to the recipient by the recipient’s financial institution for any such credit Entry will be provisional until the recipient’s financial institution has received final settlement through a Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise has received payment as provided for in Section 4A-403(a) of Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in the State of New York. If the recipient’s financial institution does not receive such payment for the credit Entry, the recipient’s financial institution is entitled to a refund from the recipient in the amount of the credit to the recipient’s account, and you will not be considered to have paid the amount of the credit Entry to the recipient. </p><h3 id="4-custodial-account-fdic-insurance">4.

Despite Section 5.2 of the General Terms, SPC and its Affiliates will not invest funds held in the Custodial Accounts, except as contemplated under Section 8.6 of these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms. Funds in the Custodial Accounts are expected to be eligible for pass-through FDIC Insurance, up to the then-current per depositor limit. FDIC Insurance coverage is contingent on determinations FDIC makes at the time the Treasury Bank goes into receivership or other form of insolvency. The FDIC Insurance per depositor limit applies to the aggregate of all funds that you have on deposit with the relevant Treasury Bank as beneficial owner, including all funds in another account with the Treasury Bank. FDIC Insurance applies only to funds that have settled in a Financial Account and does not apply to funds that are provisionally credited to a Financial Account or that are pending but not yet settled.</p><h3 id="5-set-up-and-operation-of-the-financial-account">5.

You must use the Stripe Treasury Dashboard only in compliance with the documentation that your Stripe Connect Platform makes available to you.</p><h4 id="83-account-security">8.3    Account Security.</h4><p>You must keep your account credentials and the devices on which you access your Financial Account secure and confidential at all times. You must notify SPC immediately at treasury-support@stripe.com if there has been any actual or suspected unauthorized access to your credentials. In addition to being responsible for Financial Account Transactions conducted on your Financial Account, you are responsible for all losses, damages and costs that SPC and its Affiliates suffer as a result of your delay in notifying SPC of the unauthorized access.</p><h4 id="84-representations-and-warranties">8.4    Representations and Warranties.</h4><p>You represent on the date you first use the Stripe Treasury Services, and warrant at all times during the Term, that:</p><p>(a)     you are engaged in a commercial business enterprise organized and operating in the Stripe Treasury Territory; </p><p>(b)     you reside in the Stripe Treasury Territory;</p><p>(c) you do not use the Financial Account to send or receive a payment to or from any bank account or any wire transfer provider located outside the Stripe Treasury Territory;</p><p>(d) you comply with all Treasury Regulatory Requirements in connection with your use of the Stripe Treasury Services; </p><p>(e) no funds transferred into your Financial Account are proceeds from any criminal activity; and</p><p>(f) you do not use the Stripe Treasury Services to enable any individual or entity (including you) to benefit from any Restricted Business.</p><h4 id="85-authorization-to-share-information">8.5    Authorization to Share Information.</h4><p>Unless the Treasury Regulatory Requirements or Stripe’s <a class="

  " href="https://stripe.com/privacy" data-js-controller="AnalyticsButton" data-analytics-category="Links" data-analytics-action="Clicked" data-analytics-label="Related content">Privacy Policy</a> prohibits SPC from doing so, you authorize SPC and its Affiliates to share information about you, your Financial Account, and Financial Account Transactions, with your Stripe Connect Platform and other third parties, including the Treasury Bank:</p><p>(a)     to open the Financial Account and complete Financial Account Transactions;</p><p>(b) in connection with investigating any claim you initiate; </p><p>(c) to comply with Law applicable to Stripe, the Treasury Bank or your Stripe Connect Platform; and </p><p>(d) to comply with an arbitration order.</p><h4 id="86-interest">8.6    Interest.</h4><p>(a) <em>No Interest Unless Advised</em>. Unless your Stripe Connect Platform advises you otherwise, you will not earn interest on funds in your Financial Account.</p><p>(b) <em>Allocation of Interest</em>. If SPC establishes an interest-bearing Custodial Account and your Stripe Connect Platform informs you that your Financial Account will bear interest, then SPC will allocate accrued interest under that Custodial Account in the proportion that your average daily balance during the preceding month bears to the average daily balance of all funds that are held in that Custodial Account over the same time period and calculated on the same basis. SPC will allocate interest to your Financial Account only in whole cents. Any fractional amount of the interest amount that would otherwise be credited to your Financial Account that is less than half of one cent will be rounded down and that fractional amount will be carried over to the following month. Any fractional amount of the funds equal to half of one cent or more will be rounded up and that fractional amount will be carried forward as negative accrual to the following month.</p><h4 id="87-legal-process">8.7    Legal Process.</h4><p>You authorize SPC to comply with each Legal Process relating to you or your Financial Account that SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform receives, without needing to determine whether that Legal Process was validly issued or is enforceable. If a Hold is in effect, SPC will continue to charge all applicable fees, even though your Financial Account cannot be closed. SPC may charge you a fee for, and recover SPC’s costs incurred in, complying with each Legal Process. If the Treasury Regulatory Requirements permit, SPC will deduct those fees and costs from your Available Treasury Balance.</p><h4 id="88-abandoned-property">8.8    Abandoned Property.</h4><p>If the Treasury Regulatory Requirements presume you have abandoned your Financial Account, then SPC will turn over the Available Treasury Balance (excluding funds subject to pending debit Financial Account Transactions or Holds) to the appropriate Governmental Authority in the Stripe Treasury Territory according to the Treasury Regulatory Requirements. You must follow the procedures that the Governmental Authority specifies to obtain your funds.</p><h3 id="9-transactions-on-your-financial-account">9.  Transactions on Your Financial Account.</h3><h4 id="91-available-treasury-balance">9.1    Available Treasury Balance.</h4><p>Solely for the purpose of determining whether funds are available to be transferred or paid out of your Financial Account, the Available Treasury Balance is (a) increased by the amount of any pending provisionally credited Financial Account Transactions (excluding pending returns) in your Financial Account; and (b) decreased by the amount of Holds on funds in your Financial Account. You can view your Available Treasury Balance on the Stripe Treasury Dashboard.</p><h4 id="92-adding-funds-to-your-financial-account">9.2    Adding Funds to Your Financial Account.</h4><p>(a) <em>How to Add Funds</em>. You may add funds to your Financial Account by a Financial Account Transaction (such as a direct deposit or an electronic transfer from an external account you own), wire transfer, or from another account at a Treasury Bank. </p><p>(b) <em>Agency</em>. You authorize SPC to act as your agent with regard to processing and collecting your Financial Account Transactions. SPC may endorse any credit Financial Account Transaction you present to be added to your Financial Account. If there is a qualified endorsement on a credit Financial Account Transaction, SPC may place your unqualified endorsement on the credit Financial Account Transaction. </p><p>(c) <em>No Obligation to Notify</em>. SPC is not obligated to notify you promptly after funds are added into your Financial Account. You can confirm via the Stripe Treasury Dashboard whether SPC has received a Financial Account Transaction that adds funds to your Financial Account.</p><h4 id="93-transfers-from-your-financial-account">9.3    Transfers from your Financial Account.</h4><p>By initiating a transfer from your Financial Account via the Stripe Treasury Dashboard, you authorize your Stripe Connect Platform to instruct SPC to make the Financial Account Transaction you specify. SPC may deduct the amount of each transfer that your Stripe Connect Platform initiates or approves from your Available Treasury Balance, even if the transfer has not yet been completed. SPC may refuse any transfer (a) by any method that SPC does not specifically permit for your Financial Account; or (b) that does not include all information SPC or the Treasury Bank requires.</p><h4 id="94-funds-availability">9.4    Funds Availability.</h4><p>(a)     <em>Cut-Off Times</em>. SPC establishes Cut-Off Times for various Financial Account Transactions and SPC will provide those Cut-Off Times to you through the Stripe Treasury Dashboard or otherwise in writing. SPC may change the Cut-Off Time from time to time. Any change to the Cut-Off Time will be effective immediately and without notice to you. You may contact SPC at any time to verify the Cut-Off Time.</p><p>(b)     <em>Relevance of Cut-Off Times</em>. Subject to Section 9.4(c) of these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms, funds from ACH, wire transfer or a transfer from an account with the Treasury Bank that SPC receives from your Stripe Connect Platform before the Cut-Off Time will be available in your Financial Account on that business day. SPC must receive requests that you make via the Stripe Treasury Dashboard to transfer funds from your Financial Account before the Cut-Off Time in order to initiate the transfer on the same business day. If SPC receives a transfer request on or after the Cut-Off Time or on a day that is not a business day, SPC will generally initiate the transfer on the next business day.</p><p>(c)     <em>Right to Hold Transfers</em>. SPC may Hold funds transferred to your Financial Account by ACH, wire transfer or a transfer from a Financial Account with the Treasury Bank if SPC has reasonable cause to doubt collectability, is concerned about potential fraud, including for new Financial Accounts or large transfers of funds, or is concerned about compliance with the Treasury Regulatory Requirements. SPC may place a Hold for more than your Available Treasury Balance.</p><h4 id="95-account-numbers">9.5    Account Numbers.</h4><p>SPC and any other person involved in the Financial Account Transaction may rely on the routing number and account number that you provide when giving a transfer instruction. If the transfer instruction gives both a routing number or account number and a name, and the name identifies a different person from the account owner identified by the number, SPC and any other person that handles the instruction may still rely exclusively on the number.</p><h4 id="96-processing-order">9.6    Processing Order.</h4><p>SPC will process your Financial Account Transactions on each business day in the following order:</p><p>(a)     first, transfers to your Financial Account that SPC receives from your Stripe Connect Platform before the Cut-Off Time will be processed in the order in which SPC receives them, but any amounts credited to your Financial Account are provisionally credited until those funds clear; and</p><p>(b)     second, transfers from your Financial Account (e.g., other Financial Account Transactions resulting in deducting funds from your Financial Account) that SPC receives by the Cut-Off Time will be processed in the order in which SPC receives them.</p><p>Reversals of provisional credits may occur at any time during this process. SPC may use a different processing order if the Treasury Regulatory Requirements require.</p><h4 id="97-no-overdrafts">9.7    No Overdrafts.</h4><p>There is no overdraft feature associated with your Financial Account. If your Available Treasury Balance is not sufficient to pay for each Financial Account Transaction in the order in which it is processed, SPC may return or reject the Financial Account Transaction, or SPC may permit the Financial Account Transaction to proceed, in which case your Financial Account may become overdrawn. SPC does not impose a fee when it returns or rejects a Financial Account Transaction for which there are insufficient funds. However, third parties may impose a fee or other charge (such as penalty interest) for dishonored or late payments, and you are solely responsible for those fees and charges. </p><h4 id="98-use-of-provisional-funds">9.8    Use of Provisional Funds.</h4><p>All Financial Account Transactions credited to your Financial Account are provisionally credited subject to final settlement. If SPC permits you to transfer funds from your Financial Account before final settlement has been made for any provisionally credited Financial Account Transaction, and final settlement is not made, then you will be liable to SPC for the amount of the drawn provisional credit, collection costs, attorneys’ fees, and all other losses, damages or costs that SPC incurs in allowing the Financial Account Transaction to proceed. SPC has the right to (a) charge your Financial Account; (b) obtain a refund from you; and (c) charge back any provisionally credited Financial Account Transaction. Except to the extent caused by SPC’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, SPC will not be liable for any losses, damages or costs resulting from any reversal of credit or return of any Financial Account Transactions.</p><h4 id="99-your-right-to-stop-payment">9.9    Your Right to Stop Payment.</h4><p>If you wish to stop any scheduled or preauthorized transfer from your Financial Account, then you must give your Stripe Connect Platform instructions to do so in time for the Stripe Connect Platform to instruct SPC at least 3 business days before the day on which the Financial Account Transaction is scheduled to be made. If you scheduled or preauthorized the transfer via the Stripe Treasury Dashboard, then you may change or cancel the transfer via the Stripe Treasury Dashboard at least 3 business days before the day on which the Financial Account Transaction is scheduled to be made.</p><h4 id="910-spcs-right-to-refuse">9.10   SPC’s Right to Refuse.</h4><p>To the extent the Treasury Regulatory Requirements do not prohibit the actions listed in this Section 9.10, SPC may refuse to complete any Financial Account Transaction, including:</p><p>(a)     if your Financial Account has insufficient funds to cover a Financial Account Transaction;</p><p>(b)     if SPC is unable to verify ownership of or other information about your Financial Account, or the individual or entity to or from whom the funds will be transferred;</p><p>(c)     to protect the security of your Financial Account and SPC’s systems; or</p><p>(d)     if the Financial Account Transaction would violate these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms or the Treasury Regulatory Requirements.</p><h4 id="911-financial-account-transaction-limitations">9.11   Financial Account Transaction Limitations.</h4><p>There are limits on the number and value of Financial Account Transactions that you may make from your Financial Account, which are described on the Stripe Treasury Dashboard or otherwise disclosed by SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform. SPC may allow Financial Account Transactions that exceed applicable limits, or temporarily reduce your limits from time to time without notice (unless the Treasury Regulatory Requirements require otherwise). SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform may change the limits at any time.</p><h4 id="912-reviewing-your-financial-account-transactions">9.12   Reviewing Your Financial Account Transactions.</h4><p>(a)     <em>Obligation to Review</em>. You must review your Financial Account history and each Financial Account Transaction as soon as possible. If you believe that there is an error or discrepancy in a Financial Account Transaction, you must notify your Stripe Connect Platform promptly, and no later than 30 days after your Stripe Connect Platform makes the Financial Account history available to you (or, if applicable, a longer period stated in the Treasury Regulatory Requirements). If you believe an unauthorized Financial Account Transaction has been made on your Financial Account, then you must immediately notify your Stripe Connect Platform, and in any case within 1 day after you become aware. If SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform requests, you must submit a written statement with details about the unauthorized Financial Account Transaction. If you fail to notify your Stripe Connect Platform as required under this Section 9.12(a), or your Stripe Connect Platform does not notify SPC in a timely manner, then losses, damages, or costs you suffer as a result of the unauthorized Financial Account Transaction may not be recoverable, or recovery may be more time consuming or difficult.</p><p>(b)     <em>Assistance in Investigations</em>. You must assist SPC and your Stripe Connect Platform in the investigation and related prosecution of claims for unauthorized Financial Account Transactions by completing the appropriate statements and reports that SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform reasonably requests.</p><h4 id="913-withholding-financial-account-transactions">9.13   Withholding Financial Account Transactions.</h4><p>If after final settlement of any Financial Account Transaction, you or any third party asserts a claim to your Stripe Connect Platform alleging that the Financial Account Transaction was altered, contained a forged or unauthorized signature or endorsement, or was not properly payable for any reason, then SPC may withhold the amount of the Financial Account Transaction from your Financial Account until the claim is finally investigated and resolved. </p><h4 id="914-liability-related-to-financial-account-transactions">9.14   Liability Related to Financial Account Transactions.</h4><p>You are responsible for all Financial Account Transactions on your Financial Account, whether or not they are authorized. To the maximum extent permitted by Law, the Stripe Parties will not be liable to you, your Affiliates or any third party for any losses, damages or costs arising out of or relating to:</p><p>(a)     a failed Financial Account Transaction on your Financial Account, including if SPC decides to refuse to pay or decline any Financial Account Transaction or if a Financial Account Transaction fails due to circumstances outside of SPC’s control; </p><p>(b)     SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform completing a Financial Account Transaction or otherwise acting in reliance upon any incorrect or incomplete information provided or made available to SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform;</p><p>(c) SPC’s refusal to comply with your Stripe Connect Platform’s instructions under Section 7.3 of these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms; or</p><p>(d)     any correspondent bank’s negligence or failure, or funds lost in transit.</p><h4 id="915-compliance-with-erisa">9.15   Compliance with ERISA.</h4><p>You represent on the date you first use the Stripe Treasury Services, and warrant at all times during the Term, that you do not loan funds to your Financial Account or otherwise deliver property to SPC on behalf of: </p><p>(a)     an “employee benefit plan” within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA; </p><p>(b)     a “plan” within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the IRS Code; </p><p>(c)     an entity whose underlying assets constitute “plan assets” subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4974 of the IRS Code by reason of Section 3(42) of ERISA, U.S. Department of Labor Regulation 29 C.F.R. Section 25.10.3-101 or otherwise; or </p><p>(d) a “governmental plan” (as defined in ERISA or the IRS Code) or another type of plan (or an entity whose assets are considered to include the assets of a governmental plan or other plan) that is subject to any Law or restriction that is substantively similar or of similar effect to Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the IRS Code. </p><p>You must promptly notify your Stripe Connect Platform if you breach this Section 9.15.</p><h3 id="10-fees-and-security">10.     Fees and Security.</h3><h4 id="101-fees">10.1   Fees.</h4><p>(a) <em>Fee Disclosure</em>. Your Stripe Connect Platform is responsible for disclosing to you all applicable fees (if any) that apply to your use of the Stripe Treasury Services. Your Stripe Connect Platform will disclose those fees at the time you request access to the Stripe Treasury Services and will disclose any changes before they take effect.</p><p>(b) <em>Your Responsibility for Disputes</em>. To the maximum extent permitted by Law, you are liable to SPC for all losses, damages and costs that SPC incurs as a result of any dispute involving your Financial Account, including as a result of relying on your Stripe Connect Platform’s representations or instructions. You authorize SPC to (i) deduct these losses, damages and costs from funds in your Financial Account; or (ii) set them off in accordance with Section 10.1(c) of these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms with or without prior notice to you.</p><p>(c) <em>Setoff</em>. SPC may deduct, recoup or setoff all fees you owe SPC (if any) from funds in your Financial Account, even if this would cause an overdraft. Alternatively, SPC may invoice you for some or all of those fees on a monthly basis in arrears, and you must pay the fees within 30 days after the date of the invoice.</p><h4 id="102-security-interest">10.2   Security Interest.</h4><p>(a) <em>Grant of Security to SPC</em>. To secure debt that you owe to SPC, its Affiliates, or the respective service providers of each (if any, and including amounts owed to SPC that arose from overdrafts or drawn provisional credit under Section 9.7 of these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms), you grant SPC a first-priority security interest in, lien on and right of setoff against, all of your rights in (i) your Financial Account; (ii) the funds SPC holds on your behalf in the Custodial Account (if any); (iii) the interest or income (if any) arising from the Financial Account or the funds in that account, the property acquired with the Financial Account or those funds (if any), and all rights related to the Financial Account and those funds; and (iv) the funds in your Stripe Account (if any).  The debts that are secured by this security interest, lien and right of setoff include overdrafts and fees that you may owe in relation to your Financial Account, as well as amounts owed to SPC by another individual or entity if you have guaranteed that you will pay their debts. If a debt like this is due or overdue, SPC may use the funds in your Financial Account to pay all or part of that debt. The Law of the state in which the Treasury Bank is headquartered applies to the funds SPC holds on your behalf in the Custodial Account. SPC may file financing statements under the California Uniform Commercial Code to perfect this security interest in the places, in the form and to the extent it considers necessary or appropriate. SPC will have all the rights of a secured party under the California Uniform Commercial Code with respect to this security interest.</p><p>(b) <em>No Other Securities</em>. You must not grant a security interest in, lien on or right of setoff against, any collateral described in Section 10.2(a) of these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms to any other individual or entity.</p><h3 id="11-restricting-or-closing-your-financial-account">11.     Restricting or Closing Your Financial Account.</h3><h4 id="111-restricting-your-financial-account">11.1   Restricting Your Financial Account.</h4><p>SPC may decline, delay, freeze or reverse a Financial Account Transaction or part of a Financial Account Transaction, restrict access to your Financial Account or information on your Financial Account, or remove funds from your Financial Account to hold them pending investigation to protect you, SPC or SPC’s Affiliates, or to comply with the Treasury Regulatory Requirements or other legal obligations. Examples of circumstances where SPC may exercise these rights include where:</p><p>(a) you maintain your Financial Account at $0 for at least 90 consecutive days;</p><p>(b) your Financial Account has been inactive for at least 12 months;</p><p>(c) you breach Section 8.4 of these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms;</p><p>(d) your Financial Account is involved in any Legal Process;</p><p>(e) SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform receives conflicting information or instructions regarding ownership, control or activity of your Financial Account;</p><p>(f) SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform suspects that you may be the victim of a fraud, scam or financial exploitation; and</p><p>(g) SPC or your Stripe Connect Platform suspects that a Financial Account Transaction involving you or your Financial Account may involve illegal activity or may be fraudulent.</p><h4 id="112-replacement-financial-account">11.2   Replacement Financial Account.</h4><p>SPC may transfer your Stripe Treasury Account Information and documentation to a replacement Financial Account and account number, including if your Financial Account is reported as compromised, or if SPC reasonably believes it is necessary to protect your Financial Account’s security. SPC may move SPC’s Custodial Accounts (and therefore your Financial Account) to a different financial institution.</p><h4 id="113-closing-your-financial-account">11.3   Closing Your Financial Account.</h4><p>(a) <em>By SPC</em>. SPC may close your Financial Account at any time for any reason upon notice to you or your Stripe Connect Platform.</p><p>(b) <em>By You</em>. You may close your Financial Account at any time by giving 30 days’ notice to your Stripe Connect Platform. During this 30-day period, you may transfer funds from your Financial Account in compliance with these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms.</p><p>(c) <em>SPC Can Keep Financial Account Open</em>. SPC is not required to close your Financial Account at your Stripe Connect Platform’s request if (i) you have pending Financial Account Transactions; (ii) there is an overdraft on your Financial Account; or (iii) your Financial Account is subject to Legal Process. In those cases, SPC may restrict your Financial Account against all future withdrawals, other than those made under Legal Process, until pending Financial Account Transactions are paid or returned, the account balance is no longer negative, and any legal restriction has been released. If your account balance is greater than $0, after SPC deducts fees, expenses, claims and other deductions that SPC has the right to make, SPC may require you to withdraw the remaining balance before SPC closes your Financial Account.</p><p>(d) <em>Consequences of Closing Financial Account</em>. After your Financial Account is closed, SPC has no obligation to accept funds into your Financial Account, process Financial Account Transactions through the Financial Account on your behalf, or satisfy any outstanding demands for payment. But, SPC may reopen your Financial Account if SPC receives funds payable to your Financial Account.</p><p>(e) <em>Access to Account History</em>. After your Financial Account is closed, SPC will enable your Stripe Connect Platform to provide you access to your Financial Account history for 60 days.</p><h4 id="114-adverse-claims">11.4   Adverse Claims.</h4><p>If there are conflicting instructions with respect to your Financial Account or if there is any dispute regarding your Financial Account, then without limiting SPC’s rights under these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms, SPC may refer the conflict or dispute to a court for resolution. If any person notifies SPC of a dispute, SPC does not need to decide if the dispute has merit before SPC takes further action. SPC may exercise any of these rights without notice to you.</p><h3 id="12-limitation-of-liability">12. Limitation of Liability.</h3><p>To the extent that the Treasury Regulatory Requirements invalidate or render unenforceable any limitations or exclusions of liability of SPC and its Affiliates under this Agreement with respect to failing to stop payment on a Financial Account Transaction, or paying a Financial Account Transaction bearing an unauthorized or forged signature or endorsement, then the Stripe Parties’ aggregate liability with respect to those circumstances will be limited to the face value of the Financial Account Transaction. </p><h3 id="13-interpretation">13. Interpretation.</h3><p>In these Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms, references to “business days” are to business days in the City of New York on which the Treasury Bank is open to the public for carrying on substantially all of its banking functions.</p></div>

At Stripe’s request, you must provide proof as Stripe requires that the Stripe Treasury Accountholder Terms are binding on the Connected Account.
